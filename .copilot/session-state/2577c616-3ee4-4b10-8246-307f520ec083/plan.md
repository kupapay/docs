# Task-016 Plan
- Review the sources for the security elements and note the mandated five items plus their generation rules and verification expectations.
- Sketch the structure of design/docs/fiscal/security-elements.md: introduction, per-element sections covering what it is, who generates it, receipt placement, verification, failure behavior, and a closing section linking to reports/offline behavior.
- Create a Mermaid mock receipt diagram showing where each element appears and annotate it with brief descriptions.
- Mention relevant rules from specs (e.g., security elements from docs/sfe..., canonical generation from spec, device control from technical design) and highlight compliance warnings/admonitions as needed.
- After writing, verify the file references all five elements explicitly and that the diagram is present before moving to validation.
