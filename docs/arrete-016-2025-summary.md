# Arrêté n°016/2025 — Amendment to Commercialization Rules (DRC)

**Full title:** Ministerial Order n°016/2025 modifying Arrêté n°034/2023 on commercialization of electronic fiscal devices and enterprise billing systems  
**Date:** 27 February 2025  
**Issuing body:** Ministry of Finance, Democratic Republic of Congo  
**Type:** Amendment — patches scaling bottlenecks in Arrêté 034

---

## Purpose

This is a **v1.1 patch** to Arrêté 034, not a rewrite. It rebalances market control, reduces bottlenecks, and tightens technical discipline after the first phase of implementation.

**Motivation (implicit):**
- Original Arrêté 034 was too restrictive in practice
- Vendor onboarding created friction
- Supply constraints risked slowing VAT coverage
- Technical approval cycles needed clarification
- Pricing and distributor behavior required tighter control

---

## Most Important Changes

### 1. Removal of the "Three Suppliers Only" Ceiling

**Before:** DEF suppliers artificially capped at 3, with exclusive geographic zones.  
**After:** Number of approved suppliers is **unlimited**. Approval is still conditional on technical, financial, and logistical requirements. Zoning still exists, but supply is no longer structurally scarce.

**This is the single most consequential change.** The state chose capacity scaling over enforced scarcity.

### 2. Approval Validity is Now Time-Bounded

- Supplier approval is now valid for **2 years**
- Renewable as needed
- Still subject to revocation for non-compliance

This introduces **periodic regulatory re-evaluation** rather than permanent licenses.

### 3. Financial and Technical Thresholds are Explicit

Tighter clarity around supplier requirements:
- Proven local presence
- Demonstrated technical capacity
- Financial solidity thresholds
- Availability of spare parts and maintenance capability

Reduces discretion and increases auditability of approvals.

### 4. Homologation Rules Clarified for Software Evolution

- **Minor software updates** do not require full re-homologation
- **Material or functional changes** still do
- Firmware and configuration updates may be **declared** instead of re-certified

**Critical for SFE vendors:** Iteration is allowed, but only inside a declared perimeter.

### 5. Pricing Discipline Strengthened

- DEF prices must be declared, communicated, and enforced consistently across distributors
- **Distributors cannot arbitrarily inflate prices**
- Tax authority can audit resale prices

Closes a loophole where distributor behavior could distort adoption costs.

### 6. Distributor Obligations Reinforced

Distributors are now explicitly responsible for:
- User onboarding
- Training
- After-sales support
- Fair territorial coverage
- Respecting approved pricing structures

Accountability shifts down the chain, not just at supplier level.

### 7. Enterprise System Exemption

- Large enterprise systems (e.g. ERP-integrated SFE) may be exempt from certain resale pricing constraints
- Conditional on prior declaration to the tax authority

Acknowledges enterprise reality without abandoning control.

## What Did NOT Change

- Mandatory homologation remains
- Only approved DEF and SFE can issue standardized invoices
- Withdrawal of approval remains a strong enforcement tool
- Tax authority retains final technical and commercial authority

This is still a **controlled fiscal technology ecosystem**.

## System-Level Interpretation

Across all four instruments:

| Arrêté | Function |
|--------|----------|
| 033 | Forces taxpayers onto standardized invoicing |
| 032 | Creates governance and execution authority |
| 034 | Defines the licensed vendor market |
| **016/2025** | **Fixes scaling and execution bottlenecks** |

The trajectory: start with tight control → observe friction → relax constraints selectively → preserve auditability.

This is **adaptive regulation, not deregulation**.

## Key Implications for KutaPay

1. **Market entry is now more realistic** — no artificial cap on suppliers
2. **2-year approval cycles** — renewal must be planned into business operations
3. **Minor software updates are feasible** — can iterate without full re-certification if changes are declared
4. **Pricing must be consistent** — cannot offer different prices to different distributors without disclosure
5. **Distributor accountability matters** — need reliable local partners for training and support
6. **Enterprise exemptions exist** — can negotiate special terms for large ERP-integrated clients
7. **This signals maturity** — the state is optimizing throughput, not experimenting with control
