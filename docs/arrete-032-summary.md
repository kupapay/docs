# Arrêté n°032/2023 — Governance of the Standardized Invoice Reform (DRC)

**Full title:** Ministerial Order establishing the Governance Committee for the implementation of the Standardized Invoice and Electronic Fiscal Devices project  
**Date:** 23 October 2023  
**Issuing body:** Ministry of Finance, Democratic Republic of Congo  
**Type:** Institutional / governance (not operational)

---

## Purpose

This order does **not** introduce new taxpayer obligations. It creates the **command-and-control layer** that oversees the entire standardized invoicing reform defined in Arrêté 033.

Stated objectives:
- Improve domestic revenue mobilization, especially VAT
- Fight fiscal fraud and economic crime
- Enable real-time monitoring of VAT transactions
- Coordinate public institutions, vendors, and technical partners
- Ensure disciplined execution of the standardized invoicing project

---

## Governance Structure Created

The order establishes a **Comité de Suivi** (Implementation Oversight Committee) housed within the Ministry of Finance, with two internal organs.

### 1. Steering Committee (Comité de Pilotage)

**Role:** Decision-making authority — controls strategy, budget, vendors, and communication.

**Composition:**
- Minister of Finance
- Vice Minister of Finance
- Director General of Taxes (DGI)
- Director General of Customs (DGDA)
- Senior digital, fiscal, and reform officials

**Responsibilities:**
- Approve the project charter and conceptual architecture
- Validate execution reports
- Approve budgets, timelines, and disbursement plans
- Approve procurement documents and vendor selection criteria
- Approve communication strategies for taxpayers and the public

### 2. Technical Committee (Comité Technique)

**Role:** Execution and design authority — where actual system design power lives.

**Composition:**
- IT directors from tax and customs
- Fiscal experts
- Legal advisors
- Digital systems experts
- Inspectors and large-enterprise specialists

**Responsibilities:**
- Design the technical roadmap
- Produce system architecture and specifications
- Draft budgets and implementation schedules
- Supervise system rollout
- Define KPIs and evaluation indicators
- Oversee public procurement processes
- Monitor operational effectiveness

### 3. Technical Secretariat

**Role:** Institutional memory, coordination hub, and documentation center.

- Members appointed directly by the Minister's office
- Strict cap on size — reinforces centralized control
- Handles correspondence and record-keeping

## External Technical Providers

The order explicitly allows:
- Use of external technical service providers
- Embedding provider experts into the project
- Paying those experts through the provider, not the state

This creates a **state–vendor hybrid execution model**, typical of large fiscal digitization projects in emerging markets.

## Key Signals

| Signal | Implication |
|--------|------------|
| Long-term infrastructure project | Not a one-off reform — continuous iteration expected |
| Technical vendors are politically embedded | Vendor approval is political as well as technical |
| Control sits at ministerial level | Not departmental — this is a national priority |
| Fiscal digitization = national revenue security | Treated with the same seriousness as defense or banking |
| Technical specs can change via committee decisions | Without new laws — compliance means alignment with governance |

---

## How This Fits with the Other Arrêtés

| Document | Question it answers |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Arrêté 033** | How must taxpayers invoice? |
| **Arrêté 032 (this one)** | Who controls, designs, and enforces the system? |
| **Arrêté 034** | Who is allowed to sell the technology? |
| **Arrêté 016/2025** | How are scaling bottlenecks fixed? |

Together they form a vertically integrated fiscal control system:
- 033 forces taxpayers onto standardized invoicing
- **032 creates governance and execution authority**
- 034 controls the technology supply chain
- 016/2025 optimizes throughput and removes artificial scarcity

## Implications for KutaPay

1. **Technical specifications can change without new legislation** — the Technical Committee has design authority. Architecture must be adaptable.
2. **Vendor approval is both technical and political** — relationships with DGI, DGDA, and the Steering Committee matter.
3. **APIs, data schemas, and device rules will evolve** — build for change, not for a frozen spec.
4. **Compliance means alignment with governance, not just code correctness** — staying engaged with the committee process is a business requirement.
5. **External provider embedding is expected** — KutaPay can position itself as a technical partner, not just a vendor.
