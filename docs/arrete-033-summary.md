# Arrêté n°033/2023 — Standardized Invoice & Electronic Fiscal Device Rules (DRC)

**Full title:** Ministerial Order implementing standardized electronic invoicing and the use of electronic fiscal devices for VAT control  
**Date:** 23 October 2023  
**Issuing body:** Ministry of Finance, Democratic Republic of Congo  
**Type:** Operational — defines taxpayer obligations and device usage

---

## Purpose

This is the **core operational regulation**. It explains how standardized invoices must be issued, which devices and systems are allowed, who must use them, and what happens when they fail or are misused.

At a systems level, this is a **real-time VAT surveillance framework**, not merely an invoicing reform.

---

## Core Concept: Standardized Electronic Invoices

Any VAT-registered person or company that sells goods or services must issue a standardized invoice for **every transaction**. This invoice is only valid if it is generated through an **approved electronic fiscal system** and transmitted to the tax authority.

**No invoice. No compliance. Connectivity issues are not an excuse.**

---

## Two Parallel Enforcement Paths

The regulation defines two enforcement architectures that coexist.

### 1. Physical Electronic Fiscal Devices (DEF physiques)

Hardware devices installed at points of sale:
- **UF (Unité de Facturation):** A billing unit that generates invoices
- **MCF (Module de Contrôle de Facturation):** A control module that verifies and transmits invoice data

These devices must:
- Be purchased from approved suppliers
- Be activated by the tax authority
- Remain sealed and connected to GSM networks
- Transmit transaction data to the tax authority servers

**Hardware failure does not excuse non-invoicing.** A fallback system is mandatory.

### 2. Dematerialized Electronic Systems (e-UF and e-MCF)

Software-based systems provided or supervised by the tax authority.

Requirements:
- A registered account on the tax platform
- Internet access
- A compatible enterprise billing system (SFE), if applicable

**Even here, users must maintain access to a physical replacement device** if the dematerialized system fails.

This is a **deliberate redundancy design** to eliminate any invoicing gap.

---

## Taxpayer Obligations

VAT-registered users must:
- Issue a standardized invoice for **every transaction**
- Display a visible notice telling customers to demand standardized invoices
- Install devices at **all sales locations**
- Allow tax inspectors **unrestricted access** for verification
- Maintain logs for corrections, cancellations, and credit notes
- Regularize missed invoices within strict timelines
- Report device failures immediately
- Keep **replacement systems available at all times**

This shifts compliance from periodic reporting to **continuous operational discipline**.

---

## Vendor and Software Provider Obligations

Suppliers of fiscal devices and billing systems must:
- Obtain prior approval and certification
- Meet technical specifications defined by the tax authority
- Provide maintenance and after-sales support
- Ensure data integrity, security, and transmission reliability

This creates a **licensed fiscal technology market**, not an open one.

---

## Device Lifecycle Control

- Every physical device must be **activated by the tax authority** before use
- Deactivation procedures are centrally defined
- Devices may be deactivated for business closure, suspension, or regulatory reasons
- Misuse triggers fiscal and criminal sanctions under existing VAT law

The state has **lifecycle control** over revenue instrumentation.

---

## Financial Incentives and Penalties

- Taxpayers may recover **50% of the acquisition cost** of physical devices as a tax credit
- Non-compliance triggers penalties defined under VAT legislation
- There is **no safe harbor** for technical excuses

---

## Transition Period

Users of enterprise billing software were given **3 months, extendable by 2 more**, to comply and update their systems after the order was signed.

## Key Implications for KutaPay

1. **Offline issuance is mandatory** — the device must fiscalize locally; transmission is deferred
2. **Fallback hardware is required** even for software-based systems
3. **Every sale must produce a fiscal event** — no exceptions
4. **The device is per-outlet** — installed at all sales locations
5. **50% tax credit on hardware** — lowers adoption barrier for merchants
6. **Vendor certification is required** — KutaPay must pass homologation
7. **Continuous compliance, not periodic** — the system must be always-on
