# Arrêté n°034/2023 — Commercialization of Fiscal Devices & Billing Systems (DRC)

**Full title:** Ministerial Order setting the conditions for commercialization of electronic fiscal devices (DEF) and enterprise billing systems (SFE)  
**Date:** 23 October 2023  
**Issuing body:** Ministry of Finance, Democratic Republic of Congo  
**Type:** Market control — regulates who can sell, build, and operate fiscal technology

---

## Purpose

This order determines:
- Who can sell fiscal hardware
- Who can sell billing software
- How approval and certification work
- How many suppliers are allowed
- Where they can operate
- Under what conditions approval can be withdrawn

This is **market design by regulation**, not a technical appendix.

## Four Regulated Roles

| Role | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **DEF** | Physical electronic fiscal devices (UF and MCF hardware) |
| **SFE** | Enterprise billing systems (software) |
| **Suppliers** | Entities that manufacture or develop DEF or SFE |
| **Distributors** | Entities that sell, install, and maintain DEF hardware |

Hardware and software are regulated differently.

## Approval Pipeline (Multi-Stage, Centralized)

### Step 1: Pre-qualification (Agrément)
- Managed by a committee under the Director General of Taxes
- Maximum duration: **30 working days**
- Requires proof of:
  - Technical capability
  - Financial and logistical capacity
  - Nationwide installation and maintenance ability
  - Minimum **24-month partnership** with a certified manufacturer

### Step 2: Homologation (Technical Certification)
- Separate committee verifies conformity and reliability
- Physical prototypes or software systems must be submitted
- Both **functional tests and reliability tests** required
- Maximum duration: **30 working days**
- **Any later modification triggers re-homologation**

### Step 3: Authorization to Sell
- Only homologated DEF models and SFE systems may be used
- Anything else is **illegal**

---

## Artificial Scarcity by Design (Original Version)

- Only **three DEF suppliers** retained nationally
- Assigned **exclusive geographic zones**
- Selection via public procurement and random allocation by judicial officer

This created:
- Regional monopolies
- Predictable enforcement
- Easier monitoring of vendors

*(Note: This limit was later removed by Arrêté 016/2025)*

## Distribution Model

Suppliers must build and manage distributor networks. Distributors must:
- Sell devices
- Install them
- Train users
- Provide after-sales maintenance

**Users cannot self-install.** This ensures traceability and human enforcement presence.

---

## DEF Supplier Obligations

Suppliers must:
- Maintain stock availability
- Hold safety stock and replenish within **60 days**
- Guarantee spare parts for at least **3 years**
- Report monthly sales with device identifiers and buyer details
- Notify authorities of any hardware or software changes
- Communicate prices to the tax authority

Suppliers become **quasi-agents of the tax administration**.

---

## SFE (Software) Provider Obligations

SFE systems must guarantee:
- **Immutability** — original records cannot be altered
- **Security** — data integrity and recovery guarantees
- **Retention** — daily, monthly, annual closures
- **Archiving** — minimum **1-year archival** with legal integrity

Violations expose the provider, co-authors, and complicit parties to **fiscal and criminal sanctions**.

---

## Pricing Rules

- DEF and SFE prices are freely set
- But prices **must be disclosed** to the tax authority
- Any price change must be reported
- Approval can be withdrawn for violations

This is **soft price control via visibility**.

---

## Withdrawal of Approval

Approval and certification can be revoked if:
- The supplier is dissolved
- Obligations are not met after formal notice
- Non-homologated products are commercialized

Revocation decisions are:
- Issued by the Director General of Taxes
- Published in the Official Journal

## Key Implications for KutaPay

1. **Entry barriers are intentionally high** — homologation is a competitive moat once achieved
2. **Re-homologation on changes** — freezes product evolution unless re-approved; firmware/software updates must be planned carefully
3. **24-month manufacturer partnership required** — may need a hardware partner for pre-qualification
4. **Distributor network required** — cannot just ship devices; need local install & support
5. **Price transparency** — pricing must be disclosed to DGI
6. **Software immutability obligations** — fiscal modules must be frozen in production
7. **3-year spare parts guarantee** — hardware design must account for long-term support
