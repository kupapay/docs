# Active Context

## Status
The project is in pre-implementation mode; the team is building the technical design documentation and scaffolding (MkDocs, memory bank, spec / architecture docs) before any software or hardware is prototyped.

## Focus areas
1. Capture motivations, constraints, and architecture intent in the memory bank and implementation plan.
2. Produce the specification (Task-003) and MkDocs content (Task-004 onward) that will guide future design, development, and validation work.
3. Keep open the critical questions around the DGI MCF/e-MCF interface, USB protocol details, and the trust boundary rules so implementation stays aligned with regulators.

## Next steps
- Complete Task-002 (memory bank) to preserve institutional knowledge.
- Write the architecture specification (Task-003) in EARS notation.
- Begin Phase 1 (architecture overview and trust boundary deep dives) once the docs are in place.
