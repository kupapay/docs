# Active Context

## Status

The project is in pre-implementation mode, focused on rewriting the technical documentation, specs, and memory bank to reflect the software-first Bono Pay fiscal platform before any code or hardware is prototyped.

## Focus areas

1. Capture the strategic pivot: archive hardware docs, restructure the nav, and rewrite specs for the Cloud Signing Service (HSM) as the primary fiscal authority.
2. Build the new architecture, platform, fiscal, cloud, regulatory, and API pages that describe the invoicing platform saga from Phase 1 through Phase 4.
3. Keep the open unknowns (MCF/e-MCF API, signature format, registration protocol) visible so future research spikes can chase them down.

## Next steps

- Finalize the rewritten architecture spec and supporting MkDocs content.
- Populate the new platform, fiscal, cloud, and implementation pages per the plan, including the ADRs for cloud signing and the strategic pivot.
- Continue updating the memory bank and implementation plan as tasks transition from READY to DONE.
