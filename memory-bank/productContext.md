# Product Context

## Why KutaPay exists
DRC businesses must deliver legally recognized invoices under the Facture Normalisée mandate, but regulators insist on a trusted fiscal authority that ordinary POS software cannot provide on its own. KutaPay supplies that trusted layer so transactions become verifiable tax events without forcing merchants to rip out their existing workflows.

## Problems KutaPay solves
- Enforces the trust boundary by making the USB device the only component that signs, timestamps, and numbers invoices.
- Delivers offline-first fiscalization so connectivity is never an excuse for non-compliance.
- Supports every regulatory invoice type (sale, advance, credit note, export invoice, export credit note) plus required reports (Z, X, A, audit export).
- Handles the 14 DGI tax groups and mandatory client classification without hardcoding a single VAT rate.
- Ensures voids and refunds become new fiscal events instead of mutating existing records.

## Target users
- Service companies, wholesalers, schools, and other B2B firms in Phase 1.
- Retailers and restaurants (Phase 2) with multi-terminal needs.
- ERP and commerce integrators (Phase 3) who will embed sealing plus reporting.
- POS developers, auditors, and DGI regulators who demand auditable trails and immutable journals.

## UX goals
- Keep POS workflows familiar: users prepare invoices, confirm payment, and await a sealed response.
- Make receipts instantly verifiable with fiscal numbers, QR codes, and signed payload metadata.
- Minimize downtime with local fiscalization, deterministic canonical payloads, and queued cloud uploads.
- Provide clear developer docs, diagrams, and ADRs so new teams can trust the system without reverse engineering.
